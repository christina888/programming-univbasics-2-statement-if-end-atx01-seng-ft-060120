chance_of_rain = 1.0 
puts "Let's go outside!" 
    #starting statement...stays constant
if chance_of_rain > 0.5 #conditional statement...
  puts "pack an umbrella!"
else 
  puts "Enjoy the fine day!"
end
puts "Oh, and always wear sunscreen!" 
    #end statement...also stays constant

#So our formula looks like this:
#"Let's go outside!"
#A: Pack an umbrella! B) Enjoy the fine day!
#"Oh, and always wear sunscreen!""
